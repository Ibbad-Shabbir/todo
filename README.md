# TODO LIST 💻📑

Hey everyone, 🙋🏻‍♂️ I hope y'all are fine, as the days passes it is getting harder and harder to manage our daily routine, with little to no vision or plan on what to do?? everything is clustered up in our minds.

To solve this issue, I have built a to-do application 🚀 using my trustworthy typescript and beautiful libraries like ORA and CHALK to enhance the visuals of the application. Here are some of many features in my to-do app.

## FEATURES 🤸🏻‍♀️

👉🏻 Priorities: Tasks can be divided into 3 priorities, High, Medium, Low, each with its own respective color for a more visually appealing user experience. <br> <br>
👉🏻 CURD: This application is purely based on CURD operations, (Create, Update, Read, Delete), you can update your to-do list in real time and view your created tasks too, as shown in the example below. <br> <br>
👉🏻 Animations: Each operation has its own animation for a better user experience. <br>

To run it for yourself just write this in your preferred shell:


```bash

$npx ibbad-todo@latest

```

I hope you'd like this application :)
